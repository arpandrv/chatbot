  - "helping people", "I help others", "we help each other"
  - "caring for people", "supporting friends" 
  - "good at helping family", "me and mom help each other"
- **Validation:** Same phrase → different intent based on conversation step
- **Result:** ✅ PASS - Context successfully disambiguates meaning

#### ✅ `test_clear_family_words_stay_consistent`
- **Test Cases:** "mom", "dad", "family", "friends", "my family"
- **Expected:** Always `support_people`, higher confidence at support step
- **Result:** ✅ PASS - Clear words don't change meaning

#### ✅ `test_negation_consistent_across_contexts`
- **Test Cases:** "not helping anyone", "nobody helps me", "can't help others"
- **Expected:** Always `negation` with similar confidence
- **Result:** ✅ PASS - Negation detection context-independent

#### ✅ `test_compound_complex_statements`
- **Test Cases:** Complex dual-meaning statements
  - "my sister helps me but I also help her"
  - "good at helping but need help too"
- **Validation:** Context influences interpretation appropriately
- **Result:** ✅ PASS - Handles grammatical complexity

### 4. Cultural & Linguistic Variation Tests

#### ✅ `test_typos_and_cultural_variations_handled`
