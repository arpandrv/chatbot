"""
LLM-related higher-level tests placeholder

Comments only â€” implementation to be added later.

Intent:
- Provide umbrella tests that cover interactions between router LLM branch and llm modules,
  complementing unit tests in test_llm_client.py and test_handoff_manager.py.

Test cases:
- Router LLM conversation branch: when FSM state == 'llm_conversation' and env LLM_ENABLED=false -> returns static unavailable message.
- With LLM_ENABLED=true: patch llm.handoff_manager.handle_llm_response to return a stub; ensure router delegates and repository save occurs.
- Error handling: when handoff raises RuntimeError, router should still return a safe message (or bubble appropriately if design changes).

Notes:
- Patch core.router.LLM_ENABLED via patch.dict(os.environ, ...); patch handler in core.router namespace.
- Avoid duplicating unit coverage from test_llm_client.py; focus on integration with router.
