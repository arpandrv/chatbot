## 📞 Quick Reference

**Test Commands:**
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test suites
python -m pytest tests/test_risk.py -v    # Risk detection
python -m pytest tests/test_fsm.py -v     # State machine

# Start development server
python app.py
```

**Key Files:**
- `core/router.py` - Main message routing logic
- `nlp/risk_detector.py` - Safety system (CRITICAL)
- `config/risk_phrases.json` - Risk phrase database
- `core/fsm.py` - Conversation flow state machine

**Safety Note:** Risk detection system is the most critical component. Any changes to risk detection require full test validation before deployment.
