# Project Status

This document summarizes the work done on the AIMhi-Y Supportive Yarn Chatbot and outlines the next steps and future enhancements.

## What has been done

We have successfully implemented the core features of the chatbot as per the implementation plan. This includes:

*   **Project Setup:** The project structure has been created, and all the necessary dependencies have been installed.
*   **Core FSM:** A Finite State Machine (FSM) has been implemented to manage the conversation flow through the 4-step AIMhi Stay Strong model.
*   **Web UI and API:** A basic web interface and a Flask-based API have been created to allow users to interact with the chatbot.
*   **NLP Pipeline:** A basic NLP pipeline has been set up with text normalization and lemmatization using spaCy.
*   **Risk Detection:** A deterministic risk detection system has been implemented to identify users in distress based on a small, initial set of risk phrases.
*   **Database Integration:** A database has been set up to store chat history, which is used to provide context to the LLM.
*   **LLM Fallback:** An LLM fallback mechanism has been implemented to handle user inputs that the rule-based system cannot understand. The LLM is surrounded by a set of guardrails to ensure its responses are safe and appropriate.
*   **Documentation:** Basic documentation has been created, including a README, a safety document, and LLM guidelines.

## What needs to be done next

### 1. Testing

This is a crucial next step. The application needs to be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is working as expected and is safe to use. The following types of tests need to be performed:

*   **Unit tests:** To test individual components, such as the FSM, the risk detector, and the LLM guardrails.
*   **Integration tests:** To test the interaction between different components, such as the FSM and the NLP pipeline.
*   **Safety tests:** To test the risk detection system with a comprehensive list of risk phrases, including misspellings and variations.
*   **End-to-end tests:** To test the complete conversation flow from the user's perspective.

### 2. Deployment

Once the application has been thoroughly tested, it can be deployed to a hosting platform to make it accessible to users.

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for the chatbot. However, there are several areas that can be improved and enhanced in the future:

*   **FSM:** The FSM can be made more sophisticated to handle more conversational nuances, such as interruptions and topic changes.
*   **Risk Detection:** The `risk_phrases.json` file should be expanded with a more comprehensive list of risk phrases, including misspellings, slang, and other variations. The risk detection logic can also be improved by using sentiment analysis to reduce false positives.
*   **Intent Classification:** The current `classify_intent` function is a placeholder. It should be replaced with a proper implementation, such as a spaCy text classifier or a dedicated NLP library, to better understand the user's intent.
*   **LLM:** We can experiment with different LLM models to find the one that works best for this application. We can also fine-tune a model on a relevant dataset to improve its performance. The guardrails can also be improved to be more robust.
*   **Content:** The `content.json` file should be expanded with more empathetic and culturally appropriate responses. The content should be reviewed by cultural advisors to ensure that it is appropriate for the target audience.
*   **UI/UX:** The user interface and user experience can be improved based on user feedback. This could include adding features such as a progress bar, a button to restart the conversation, and a way to provide feedback.
*   **Accessibility:** The application should be thoroughly tested for accessibility to ensure that it can be used by people with disabilities.
