# AIMhi-Y Supportive Yarn Chatbot - User Guide

**A safe space for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth to yarn about their wellbeing**

---

## Welcome! üëã

The AIMhi-Y Supportive Yarn Chatbot is here to support you through the **Stay Strong** approach - a 4-step conversation that helps you think through your support people, strengths, worries, and goals. This isn't therapy or medical advice, but rather a supportive yarn to help you reflect on your wellbeing.

## What You Can Expect

### ‚úÖ **The Stay Strong 4-Step Journey**

The chatbot will guide you through these steps:

1. **ü§ù Support People** - Who's in your corner? Family, friends, teachers, community members
2. **üí™ Your Strengths** - What are you good at? What makes you proud?
3. **üí≠ Worries** - What's been on your mind? Any stress or challenges?
4. **üéØ Goals** - Where do you want to go? What would you like to achieve?

At the end, you'll get a summary of everything you've shared - like a reflection of your conversation.

### ‚úÖ **Natural Conversation Style**

**You don't need to speak formally!** The chatbot understands:

- **Short responses:** "helping friends", "my mum", "school stress"
- **Natural language:** "me and my sister help each other"  
- **Aboriginal English:** "deadly at footy", "mob supports me", "yarn with family"
- **Typos and informal speech:** "helpin people", "gud at singing"

### ‚úÖ **Safety First**

If you share anything concerning about your safety, the chatbot will immediately provide crisis support resources including:
- **13YARN:** 13 92 76 (24/7 crisis support for Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander people)
